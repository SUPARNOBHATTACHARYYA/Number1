During my first semester, I was a TA for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bulletins.psu.edu\/university-course-descriptions\/undergraduate\/emch\/\">EMCH 210<\/a>\u00a0(Statics and strength of materials), and for the last 11 semesters, I have been a TA for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/bulletins.psu.edu\/university-course-descriptions\/undergraduate\/emch\/\">EMCH 212<\/a>\u00a0(Engineering dynamics). A fairly large number of students enroll in these courses. For example, the\u00a0<em>number of students in EMCH 212 can be as large as 500<\/em>\u00a0in one semester. Generally, there are more than one professor and more than one TA for this course. As a TA,\u00a0<em>my tasks include helping students understand the course material, grading their weekly assignments, grading exams, holding office hours, tutoring, providing them with useful feedback, and sometimes, teaching in class.<\/em>\u00a0EMCH 212 is an intense course. The students submit homework every week and typically, take three to four midterms and one final exam. The course typically focuses on solving problems, and the content of this course is considered to be difficult for undergraduate students. Because of this, there are multiple help sessions available for the students, provided by the TAs and the professors.<\/p>\n<p>Students typically come to me with homework problems during my office hours or during tutoring. However, I seldom give away the solution to them directly. I try to make them solve their own problems instead of solving for them. My objective is to make sure that the students understand the core concepts associated with the problem so that they have a clear idea of what is being taught and how to implement those ideas to solve similar other problems. Hence, I try to engage with them by asking simple conceptual questions related to the problem in hand and guide them step by step to solve the problem. In this way, they learn how to think and how to approach a problem.<\/p>\n<p>When I am teaching a class, I always prepare my lesson plan well in advance. Being prepared and organized creates an effective learning experience. Teaching, just like any other presentation needs practice. I usually spend three or four hours the day before to prepare for my class. Time is used more efficiently when teachers are prepared and organized.<\/p>\n<p>While solving problems in the class, I always emphasize on how to think rather than simply solving the problem. I first establish a method for solving a class of problems and reinforce the idea by solving different problems using that method. I prefer using visual tools in the classroom. For example, while solving problems I always project the problems I am going to solve using a projector and use the blackboard to solve it. In case a blackboard is not available, I email partially completed solutions to problems (leaving out conceptually difficult parts) to be solved in the next class to the students before the next class. As the students bring these notes to the class, I project the complete notes, and as I go through the notes, the students copy the missing portions onto their notes. Because of this strategy, the students can focus more on how I am solving the problem rather than focusing on copying down the solutions as well as understanding them. Moreover, I believe that visualization is one of the most helpful tools for understanding a concept. While teaching, through audio-visual aids (whenever possible), I try to generate interest among the students about the topics they are learning.<\/p>\n<p>When I was first appointed as a TA, I had to take a 1-credit course called ENGR 888. This course is intended to help new teaching assistants in the College of Engineering become more effective in their teaching. In this course, I learned about the basic responsibilities of a TA, how to interact with students, etc. However, with time I felt the need of understanding the elements of teaching. Even though I was always good at helping students, I felt having a better understanding of the craft of teaching will help me perform better as a TA. Therefore, I took<em>\u00a0OL2050 (Essentials of online teaching for grad students)<\/em>, offered by the world campus, Penn state. Completing this course helped me in two ways. First, through this course, I gained a brief yet precise understanding of the basics of teaching a course. For example, how to design a course syllabus, what are the responsibilities of an instructor, how to provide effective feedback to students, how learning works, how students learn as they are introduced to a new topic, etc. Second, this course specifically focused on online teaching. Nowadays, online classes are given almost the same importance, if not more, as the face to face university classes. This course helped me understand the nuances of online teaching. In essence, this course has enhanced my maturity as a TA and introduced me to the responsibilities of an instructor, which I believe will be quite useful for my teaching endeavors in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During my Ph.D., I have been a TA for two undergraduate courses.
